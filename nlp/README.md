[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pysummarize.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pysummarize)

Simple multi-language Python and NLTK-based implementation of text summarization.


Installation
------------

	$ pip install pysummarize


Setup
-----

Before using, make sure you have `stopwords` and `punkt` NLTK packages downloaded:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download(['stopwords', 'punkt'])
```


Quick start
-----------

```python
from summarize import summarize
summarize("Alice and Bob are friends. Alice is fun and cuddly."
          " Bob is cute and quirky. Together they go on wonderful"
          " adventures in the land of tomorrow. Alice's cuddlines"
          " and Bob's cuteness allow them to reach their goals."
          " But before they get to them, they have to go past their"
          " mortal enemy - Mr. Boredom. He is ugly and mean. They"
          " will surely defeat him. He is no match for their abilities.")
```


Usage
-----

	summarize(text[, sentence_count=5, language='english'])

- `text`

  text to be summarized

- `sentence_count`

  number of sentences needed

- `language`

  language that the text is in (lowercase)


Supported languages
-------------------

In theory, any language with full support in NLTK (stemming, sentence tokenization and stopwords) should work.

### Working

- English
- Spanish

### Supported by NLTK, but untested results

- Danish
- Dutch
- Finnish
- French
- German
- Italian
- Norwegian
- Portuguese
- Swedish
